## Adding a conference

Conferences are JSON based files. They have the following structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "",
    "url": "",
    "startDate": "2018-08-17",
    "endtDate": "2018-08-19",
    "city": "",
    "country": "",
    "cspUrl": "",
    "twitter": "",
  }
```
Dates are formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD`, and if the date has not been defined yet, you can use this format as well: `YYYY-MM`.
